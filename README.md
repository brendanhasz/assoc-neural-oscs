# Associative Neural Oscillators
`assoc-neural-oscs` is a collection of programs which simulate and explore the ability of [neural oscillators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_oscillation) to "remember" phase associations amongst themselves.  Specifically, the programs study [Pyramidal-Interneuron gamma-frequency oscillators](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15802007) (PING oscillators), which resemble networks found in the cortex and hippocampus.
