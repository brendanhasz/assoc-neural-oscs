Learned Synchrony between 2 oscillators

We start with cross-oscillator syn strengths which give rise to 
attractor-like properties (as in 2-3).

This causes the oscillators to be in-phase when started in-phase, and
out-of-phase when started out-of-phase.

Then we allow the xEE strength to change over time as we synchronize
them, or simulate them out-of-phase

Simulating init-in and init-out with new weights for each case, we see
that...?
