	*** VECTOR FUNCTIONS ***
	vcpy - Copy a vector
	vrand - Fill a vector with random numbers from 0 to 1
	vrandn - Generate a vector of numbers drawn from a gaussian distribution
	vmax - Find the maximum value in a vector
	vmin - Find the minimum value in a vector
	maxindex - Find the index of the max value in a vector
	vfill - Fill a vector with a given value
	zeros - Fill a vector with zeros
	ones - Fill a vector with ones
	linspace - Generate a vector of linearly spaced values within a range
	vgauss - Generate a gaussian function vector
	diff - Find the derivative of a function vector
	TODO: diff1 - Efficient differentiation
